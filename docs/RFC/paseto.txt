               PASETO: Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens
                   draft-paragonie-pasetorfc-draft00

Abstract

   Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOkens (PASETO) provides a
   cryptographically secure, compact, and URL-safe representation of
   claims that may be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a
   PASETO are encoded as a JavaScript Object (JSON), version-tagged, and
   either encrypted or signed using public-key cryptography.

1.  Introduction

   Platform-Agnostic SEcurity TOken (PASETO) is a cryptographically
   secure, compact, and URL-safe representation of claims intended for
   space-constrained environments such as HTTP Cookies, HTTP
   Authorization headers, and URI query parameters.  PASETOs encode
   claims to be transmitted in a JSON [RFC7159] object, and is either
   encrypted or signed using public-key cryptography.

1.1.  Difference Between PASETO and JOSE

   The key difference between PASETO and the JOSE family of standards
   (JWS [RFC7516], JWE [RFC7517], JWK [RFC7518], JWA [RFC7518], and JWT
   [RFC7519]) is that JOSE allows implementors and users to mix and
   match their own choice of cryptographig algorithms (specified by the
   "alg" header in JWT), while PASETO has clearly defined protocol
   versions to prevent users without a cryptography engineering
   background from selecting or permitting an insecure configuration.

   PASETO is defined in two pieces:

   1.  The PASETO Message Format, defined in Section 3

   2.  The PASETO Protocol Version, defined in Section 4

2.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, the key words "*MIGHT*", "*COULD*", "*MAY WISH TO*",
   "*WOULD PROBABLY*", "*SHOULD CONSIDER*", and "*MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU
   WON'T)*" in this document are to interpreted as described in RFC 6919
   [RFC6919].

3.  PASETO Message Format

   Without the Optional Footer:

                          version.purpose.payload

   With the Optional Footer:

                      version.purpose.payload.footer

   The *version* is a string that represents the current version of the
   protocol.  Currently, two versions are specified, which each possess
   their own ciphersuites.  Accepted values: *v1*, *v2*.

   The *purpose* is a short string describing the purpose of the token.
   Accepted values: *local*, *public*.

   o  *local*: shared-key authenticated encryption

   o  *public*: public-key digital signatures; *not encrypted*

   Any optional data can be appended to the end.  This information is
   NOT encrypted, but it is used in calculating the authentication tag
   for the payload.  It's always base64url-encoded.
