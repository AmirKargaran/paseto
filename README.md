PAST is everything you love about JOSE (JWT, JWE, JWS) without any of the
[many design deficits that plague the JOSE standards](https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid).

What follows is a reference implementation. **Requires PHP 7 or newer.**

## Example

```php
<?php
use ParagonIE\PAST\Keys\SymmetricAuthenticationKey;
use ParagonIE\Past\{Version1, Version2};

$key = new SymmetricAuthenticationKey('YELLOW SUBMARINE, BLACK WIZARDRY');
$messsage = \json_encode(['data' => 'this is a signed message', 'exp' => '2039-01-01T00:00:00']);
$footer = \json_encode(['key-id' => 'gandalf0']);

$v1Token = Version1::auth($messsage, $key);
var_dump($v1Token);
// string(156) "v1.auth.eyJkYXRhIjoidGhpcyBpcyBhIHNpZ25lZCBtZXNzYWdlIiwiZXhwIjoiMjAzOS0wMS0wMVQwMDowMDowMCJ9tHUXb9BcoicC_kXc3fxkd_jpm2Laowv7OZ4sIH0ZlKRYcO2ez_zVtp_r94dfmh3W"

$token = Version2::auth($messsage, $key, $footer);
var_dump($token);
// string(165) "v2.auth.eyJkYXRhIjoidGhpcyBpcyBhIHNpZ25lZCBtZXNzYWdlIiwiZXhwIjoiMjAzOS0wMS0wMVQwMDowMDowMCJ9hClJIR0hw-ULW0zU0023NYqpdOFmUB7-7wBP8TzILYA=.eyJrZXktaWQiOiJnYW5kYWxmMCJ9"
```

# Implementation Details

## PAST Message Format:

```
version.purpose.payload
version.purpose.one-time-key.ciphertext (sealing only)
```

The `version` is a string that represents the current version of the protocol. Currently,
two versions are specified, which each possess their own ciphersuites. Accepted values:
`v1`, `v2`.

The `purpose` is a short string describing the purpose of the token. Accepted values:
`enc`, `auth`, `sign`, `seal`.

If the `purpose` is set to `seal`, then the payload is preceded by a `one-time-key` value,
which was generated by the sender and is needed to successfully decrypt the token. This
is not present for other `purpose`s than `seal`, and is either an ephemeral (one-time)
Diffie-Hellman public key, or a random key encrypted with the recipient's long-term public
key.

The `payload` is a base64url-encoded string that contains the data that is secured. It may be
encrypted. It may use public-key cryptography. It MUST be authenticated or signed. Encrypting
a message using PAST implicitly authenticates it.

```
version.purpose.payload.optional
version.purpose.one-time-key.ciphertext.optional (sealing only)
```

Any `optional` data can be appended to the end. This information is public (unencrypted), even
if the payload is encrypted. However, it is always authenticated. It's always base64url-encoded.

 * For encrypted tokens, it's included in the associated data alongside the nonce.
 * For authenticated/signed tokens, it's appended to the message during the actual
   authentication/signing step.

## Versions

### Version 1: Compatibility Mode

* **`v1.auth`**: Symmetric Authentication:
  * HMAC-SHA384 with 256-bit keys
* **`v1.enc`**: Symmetric Encryption:
  * AES-256-CTR + HMAC-SHA384 (Encrypt-then-MAC)
  * Key-splitting: HKDF-SHA384
  * 32-byte nonce (half for AES-CTR, half for the HKDF salt)
  * The HMAC covers the header, nonce, and ciphertext
* **`v1.sign`**: Asymmetric Authentication (Public-Key Signatures):
  * 2048-bit RSA keys
  * RSASSA-PSS with
    * Hash function: SHA384 as the hash function
    * Mask generation function: MGF1+SHA384
    * Public exponent: 65537
* **`v1.seal`**: Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Encryption):
  * 2048-bit RSA keys
  * RSAES-OAEP with
    * Hash function: SHA384 as the hash function
    * Mask generation function: MGF1+SHA384
    * Public exponent: 65537
  * KEM+DEM approach:
    1. Generate a random 32-byte key
    2. Encrypt the output of step 1 with the RSA public key
    3. Calculate HKDF-SHA384 of the output of step 2, using the output of
       step 1 (the random key) as the salt
    4. Use the output of step3 as a key to perform symmetric encryption
       (i.e. AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA2)

Version 1 implements the best possible RSA + AES + SHA2 ciphersuite. We only use
OAEP and PSS for RSA encryption and RSA signatures (respectively), never PKCS1v1.5.

Version 1 is recommended only for legacy systems that cannot use modern cryptography.

### Version 2: Recommended

* **`v2.auth`**: Symmetric Authentication: 
  * Authenticating: `sodium_crypto_auth()`
  * Verifying: `sodium_crypto_auth_verify()`
* **`v2.enc`**: Symmetric Encryption:
  * Encrypting: `sodium_crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt()`
  * Decrypting: `sodium_crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt()`
* **`v2.sign`**: Asymmetric Authentication (Public-Key Signatures): 
  * Signing: `sodium_crypto_sign_detached()` 
  * Verifying: `sodium_crypto_sign_verify_detached()`
* **`v2.seal`**: Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Encryption):
  * Key exchange (`sodium_crypto_kx()`) with an ephemeral keypair,
    followed by symmetric encryption
